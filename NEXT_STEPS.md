# Next Steps to Get Your App Running

## ✅ Done
- Code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/renatodap/notebook-recall
- Environment variables configured in `.env.local`
- Supabase project created
- Anthropic API key ready

## 🔧 Required: Run Database Migration

**You MUST do this before the app will work:**

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ptdphysuhuqplisuhnqa

2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

3. Click **New Query**

4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of this file:
   ```
   recall-notebook/supabase/migrations/20250101000000_initial_schema.sql
   ```

5. Paste into the SQL editor

6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)

7. You should see: **"Success. No rows returned"**

8. Verify: Go to **Table Editor** - you should now see 3 tables:
   - `sources`
   - `summaries`
   - `tags`

## 🚀 Run the App

```bash
cd recall-notebook
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## 🧪 Test the App

1. **Sign Up** - Create an account with your email
2. **Check Email** - Confirm your account (check spam folder)
3. **Sign In** - Log in with your credentials
4. **Add Content** - Try all three tabs:
   - Text: Paste some content
   - URL: Try a blog post URL
   - PDF: Upload a small PDF
5. **View Library** - Your content should appear
6. **Search** - Try searching for keywords
7. **Detail View** - Click a source to see full summary

## ⚠️ Known Issues

**If content processing fails:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify your Anthropic API key has credits
- Try smaller content first

**If authentication fails:**
- Go to Supabase → Authentication → Users
- Manually confirm your email if needed

**If database errors occur:**
- Verify you ran the migration SQL
- Check Supabase logs for details

## 📊 Current Status

**What Works:**
✅ All features implemented
✅ Production build passes
✅ Database schema ready
✅ Authentication configured
✅ Claude API integrated

**What's Not Production-Ready:**
❌ Test coverage only 16.64% (should be ≥80%)
❌ No integration tests for API routes
❌ No component tests

**For Production Use:** You'll want comprehensive tests before deploying to real users.

## 🎯 Quick Win
