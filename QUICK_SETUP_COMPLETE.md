## 🎉 What's Been Completed

### 1. ✅ **Conversational Search** (Fully Wired)

**What was done:**
- Created `/api/search/parse` endpoint that uses Claude to parse natural language queries
- Integrated conversational search toggle into search page

**How to use:**
1. Go to `/search`
2. Enable "🗣️ Use conversational search" toggle (on by default)
3. Type natural language queries like:
   - "Show me AI notes from last week"
   - "Find PDFs about machine learning from June"
   - "What did I learn about React yesterday?"
4. See how Claude understands your query
5. Get relevant, filtered results

**Files:**
- `src/app/api/search/parse/route.ts` - Parse endpoint
- `src/app/search/page.tsx` - Updated with conversational UI
- `src/lib/search/conversational.ts` - Claude-powered query parser
